# West Nile Virus Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques
<br> <br>
## Introduction
West Nile virus is most commonly spread to humans through infected mosquitos. 
Around 20% of people who become infected with the virus develop symptoms ranging from a persistent fever, to serious neurological illnesses that can result in death.
<br> 

Given weather, location, testing, and spraying data, we predict when and where different species of mosquitos will test positive for West Nile virus. 
A more accurate method of predicting outbreaks of West Nile virus in mosquitos would help the City of Chicago and CPHD more efficiently and effectively 
allocate resources towards preventing transmission of this potentially deadly virus.
